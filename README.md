## Overview
DeepMRF is a hybrid model of deep neural network and Markov Random Field for protein design. In particular, on the one hand, we use Markov Random Filed to capture the very long-range interaction and spatial information among different sites of protein. On the other hand, we use deep learning models to capture the underling complex relationship between protein sequences and structures.
